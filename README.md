# Geometric Shapes Simulation Project
This project provides an interactive simulation of geometric shapes in Java. Users can create geometric shapes such as rectangles, triangles, polygons, and more. Additionally, the project allows users to perform various operations on the shapes, such as scaling, rotating, changing colors, sorting shapes, and more.

# Key Features:
Create new geometric shapes: rectangles, triangles, polygons, and more.
Load shapes from an external file.
Scale shapes up and down.
Rotate shapes and sort them by criteria such as area and perimeter.
Interactive GUI allowing users to perform operations easily.

# Running the Project:
Download the project files.
Run the main file Main.java or use the provided JAR file if available.
Use the graphical interface to add shapes, perform operations, and save the shapes to a file.
